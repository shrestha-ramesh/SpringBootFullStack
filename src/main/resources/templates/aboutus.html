			A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided may 
			range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, 
			a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flat screen television, 
			and suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and 
			facilities. Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, 
			business center (with computers, printers, and other office equipment), child care, conference and event 
			facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day, and social function services. 
			Hotel rooms are usually numbered to allow guests to identify 
			their room. Some high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part 
			of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a hotel is required by law to serve food and 
			drinks to all guests within certain stated hours.[citation needed] In Japan, hotels provide a 
			tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.

		<p>	The precursor to the modern hotel was the inn of medieval Europe. For a period of about 200 years from the
			mid-17th century, coaching inns served as a place for lodging for coach travelers. Inns began to cater to 
			richer clients in the mid-18th century. One of the first hotels in a modern sense was opened in 
			1768. Hotels proliferated throughout Western Europe and North America in the early 19th century, and 
			luxury hotels began to spring up in the later part of the 19th century.

		<p>Hotel operations vary in size, function, complexity, and cost. Most hotels and major hospitality 
			companies have set industry standards to classify hotel types. An full-service hotel facility 
			offers luxury amenities, full service accommodations, an on-site restaurant, and the highest level of 
			personalized service, such as a room service, and clothes pressing staff. Full service hotels 
			often contain up scale full-service facilities with many full-service accommodations, an on-site 
			full-service restaurant, and a variety of on-site amenities. hotels are smaller independent, 
			non-branded hotels that often contain up scale facilities. Small to medium-sized hotel establishments 
			offer a limited amount of on-site amenities. Economy hotels are small to medium-sized hotel 
			establishments that offer basic accommodations with little to no services. Extended stay hotels are small 
			to medium-sized hotels that offer longer-term full service accommodations compared to a traditional hotel.
		</p>
		<p>	Timeshare and destination clubs are a form of property ownership involving ownership of an individual 
			unit of accommodation for seasonal usage. A motel is a small-sized low-rise lodging with direct access to 
			individual rooms from the car park. hotels are typically hotels with a unique environment or 
			intimate setting. A number of hotels have entered the public consciousness through popular culture, such 
			as the Hotel in UK. Some hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself, for example 
			at and holiday resorts.
